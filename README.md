# Museum Bot
## What is "Museum"?
The reasoning for this bot is that my friends and I have been doing a monthly gathering to museums, galleries, restaurants, etc.

Rules:
 - Each month a different member of the group gets to choose where we all go.
 - No place can be repeated (until all local areas are exhausted).

## Supported Commands

At present, Third Thursday Bot supports the following commands:

- **show all** - Lists all of the previous Third Thursday selections.
- **have we been to {restaurant}?** - Indicates if specific restaurant has been chosen.
- **whoâ€™s next** - Indicates who has the next selection.
- **recommendation** - Get a random recommendation in the area.

## Created with
 - **Microsoft Bot Framework** - This bot relies on [the Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/) for its supported integrations, which can make getting started and actually using a bot a breeze.
 - **Firebase** - This example uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) as a database, which can be set up in a matter of minutes.
